# Homebrew Crypto

Various often experimental or unstable cryptographic-related formulae.

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap domt4/crypto` and then `brew install <formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```bash
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomT4/homebrew-crypto/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors, feel free to file an issue. A `brew gist-logs <formula>` is often handy. Thanks!
